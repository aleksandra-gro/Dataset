README

The files contain benchmark instances for the Multi-Allocation p-Hub Median Problem calculated by approximation algorithms.
The instances were used in the article 'Solving The Multi-Allocation p-Hub Median Problem With Stochastic Travel Times: A Simheuristic'.

Each branch/hub is uniformly drawn in a two-dimensional [0,1]x[0,1] space.
Each instance contains the following size and information:

2.000 flows, 100 branches, 50 potential hubs and ... samples. 

In "coordinates_branches_x", "coordinates_hubs_x" and "coordinates_mean_x", the two-dimensional coordinates of the branches, hubs and mean of the coordinates between two branches of the x'th instance are given.
In "hubs_cost_table_x", the hubs and the corresponding opening costs [0,1.2] for the uncapacitated hub location problem of the x'th instance are given.
In "input_table_x", the departure and destination branches of the x'th instance are given. Each combination exists at most once.
In addition, volume of the flows are defined by uniformly drawn numbers in [0,1.5].

Any data is unlicenced and this dataset can be used as benchmark instances by everyone.
